# Japanese Language Proficiency Test Prep aka JLPT Prep

The app allows the user to practice and review test questions, so they can become familiar with the test format and gain a general self assessment of their skills to pinpoint any areas theyâ€™d like to strengthen. The user would also be given instant feedback without relying on any translation tools.

## Motivation ##

This is a tool I wished I had when I was studying for the test myself. Test Prep books are expensive and the material is either too dense to get through without the aid of an instructor or the material does not match the difficulty of the test. Official test prep books published by the test distributors are only available in print, there are no digital learning materials available.
